# M5 - Mixed reconciliation

Code for reproducing the results of the experiments on the M5 dataset of the paper *Probabilistic reconciliation of mixed-type hierarchical time series* [@zambon2024mixed], 
published at UAI 2024 (the 40th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence).
We refer to the paper and to the vignette *Reconciliation of M5 hierarchy with mixed-type forecasts* of the R package `bayesRecon` for all the details on the experiments.
